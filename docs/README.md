# Implementation of a RISC-V compatible Multiply-Add-Fused Unit

## Abstract


## 1.Intorduction

floating point operation is curcial in modern day

Designs with a compound operation has performance advantage over separate add and multiply datapaths.

Multiply fused add unit leads to more efficient superscaler cpu design, the scheduler could 

Horner's reule for transforming a set of equations into a series of multiply-adds. 

First processor to contain a fused multiply-add dataflow ins IBM RS/6000 in 1990
